## Five Stars
a movie rating app

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

## Build for Static Hosting

To build the app for static hosting:

```bash
npm run build
```

This generates static files in the `out/` directory, ready for deployment to Firebase Hosting or any static hosting service.

## Deploy to Firebase Hosting

The app is configured for Firebase Hosting. To deploy:

```bash
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

The build output in the `out/` directory will be deployed to Firebase Hosting.
